# FlowTest for OpenVBX
-----------------------------
FlowTest allows you to test [OpenVBX][1] Call Flows - as well as the 
text-to-speech engine - using the new OpenVBX Browser Phone. Instead of 
dialing in multiple times as you tweak your flows, you can can now test 
without even using your phone.

When you start testing, the OpenVBX Browser Phone will ring, but once it's 
answered, you can continue to test different flows or the text-to-speech 
engine while the call is ongoing.

The FlowTest link will be on the OpenVBX Admin menu.
